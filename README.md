# qrcode-style-editor
A GUI application made with PyQt5 to customize qrcodes based on the 'qrcode' python library.

It can be used to create Qrcodes, customize them and save them while getting a preview of it before saving it.
As said before, it uses the 'qrcode' python library to create and customize to Qrcodes.

# How can it be improved?
Adding functionalities that I didn't think about or making suggestions of potential useful features to be added.
